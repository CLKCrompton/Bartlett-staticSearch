            <p>This is the index page for the Static Search test data set. This data set is designed
                to cover a range of different input document types and configurations in order to
                test a variety of scenarios the codebase needs to handle, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nested folders.</li>
                <li>Documents with and without ids (this has one).</li>
                <li>With and without titles (this has one).</li>
                <li>Good range of HTML elements providing scope for testing context stuff.</li>
                <li>Foreign languages and non-latin stuff such as Japanese.</li>
                <li>Hyphenated terms, single and double, such as one-way street and hard-to-process sequences.</li>
                <li>Names, both in sentence-initial and sentence medial positions. Fred Bloggs and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley are examples.</li>
                <li>Numbers such as 25, 2,302, and 3.14159, or currency amounts such as £4,500 or ¥9,000,000.</li>
                <li>Items that should not be indexed (such as line numbers attached to poetic lines).</li>
                <li>Constrained contexts which should delimit keyword-in-context ranges, such as table cells.</li>
                <li>Inline elements whose boundaries should be ignored when indexing.</li>
            </ul>
