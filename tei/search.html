      <p>This search engine supports stemming for English, 
         but not for other languages appearing in the Guidelines. 
         However, the search also supports wildcards
         ("*" means any number of characters, while "?" means a single character), 
         so you can search for partial matches in any language. The wildcard support 
         includes character classes, so you can use wildcards to account for 
         spelling idiosyncracies by searching for (e.g.) <em>analy[zs]e</em> to find
         both <em>analyse</em> and <em>analyze</em>. The search also supports boolean 
         (plus and minus) prefixes, so you can find (for example) all pages which contain
         "analyse" but not "analyze" by searching for <em>+analyse -analyze</em>.
         Finally, you can search for exact phrases using quotation marks: "a digitized
         text" will find only that phrase. </p>
