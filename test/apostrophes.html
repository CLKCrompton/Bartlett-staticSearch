                <h2>The apostrophe character</h2>
                
                <p>Representing apostrophe is problematical for various reasons,</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>There are two Unicode characters for apostrophe, U+0027 (also ASCII hex
                        27), and U+2019. Compare <br/>
                        <pre>        Hamlet's father's ghost (U+0027)
        Hamlet’s father’s ghost (U+2019)
</pre></li>
                    <li>Although conceptually different from an apostrophe, a single closing
                        quote is also represented by character U+2019.</li>
                    <li>Character U+0027 is used for apostrophe, single closing quote and
                        single opening quote (U+2018).</li>
                    <li>A fourth character, U+201B, like U+2018 but with the tail ‘rising’
                        instead of ‘descending’, is also sometimes used as apostrophe (in the
                        house style of certain publishers, for surnames like <i>M’Coy</i> and so on.)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the English stemming algorithm, it is assumed that apostrophe is
                    represented by U+0027. This makes it ASCII compatible. Clearly other codes
                    for apostrophe can be mapped to this code prior to stemming.</p>
                
                <p>In English orthography, apostrophe has one of three functions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It indicates a contraction in what is now accepted as a single word:
                        <i>o’clock</i>, <i>O’Reilly</i>, <i>M’Coy</i>. Except in proper names such forms
                        are rare: the apostrophe in <i>Hallowe’en</i> is disappearing, and in
                        <i>’bus</i> has disappeared.</li>
                    <li>It indicates a standard contraction with auxiliary or modal verbs:
                        <i>you’re</i>, <i>isn’t</i>, <i>we’d</i>. There are about forty of these forms in
                        contemporary English, and their use is increasing as they displace the full
                        forms that were at one time used in formal documents. Although they can be
                        reduced to word pairs, it is more convenient to treat them as single items
                        (usually stopwords) in IR work. And then preserving the apostrophe is
                        important, so that <i>he’ll</i>, <i>she’ll</i>, <i>we’ll</i> are not equated with
                        <i>hell</i>, <i>shell</i>, <i>well</i> etc.</li>
                    <li>It is used to form the ‘English genitive’, <i>John's book</i>, <i>the horses’
                        hooves</i> etc. This is a development of (1), where historically the apostrophe
                        stood for an elided <b><i>e</i></b>. (Similarly the printed form <b><i>’d</i></b> for <b><i>ed</i></b> was
                        very common before the nineteenth century.) Although in decline (witness <i>pigs
                            trotters</i>, <i>Girls School Trust</i>), its use continues in contemporary
                        English, where it is fiercely promoted as correct grammar, despite (or it might
                        be closer to the truth to say <i>because of</i>) its complete semantic redundancy.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For these reasons, the English stemmer treats apostrophe as a letter, removing
                    it from the beginning of a word, where it might have stood for an opening
                    quote, from the end of the word, where it might have stood for a closing quote,
                    or been an apostrophe following <b><i>s</i></b>. The form <b><i>’s</i></b> is also treated as an ending.</p>
