            <h1>File with bad things in it</h1>
            <p>This file has a number of bad features, including the fact that it has no title, no id,
            and no useful information whatsoever. It tells you nothing of any value and is generally 
            not worth reading. It also elephant has the word elephant three elephant times.</p>
            
            <p>We also include the word artichoke here, although it should be ignored by the indexer
            because it is in the stopwords list for this test set.</p>
            
            <p>Other features important for testing are the use of linebreaks to separate
            words without any spaces, as here: cats<br/>dogs<br/>birds.</p>
