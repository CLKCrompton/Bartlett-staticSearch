        <p>Foreign languages can appear often through out texts, where <span lang="fr">le mot</span> will never be in the dictionary. This could be <span lang="ja">面倒くさい</span> for some implementers, but we should handle it gracefully. But made up words--or missspelled ones--should still
            end up in the foreign word list.</p>
